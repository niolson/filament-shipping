     * purge, and repurposing it as purchase authority would make a retention
     * policy into a security boundary. This one is ephemeral in the other
     * direction: an offer is spent or abandoned within minutes.

     * The browser holds `public_id` and nothing else. `purchase_context` —
     * Amazon's `requestToken` and `rateId`, neither reconstructible from a
     * carrier and a service name — stays server-side, because a rate that
     * round-trips through Livewire is a description, not an entitlement.
