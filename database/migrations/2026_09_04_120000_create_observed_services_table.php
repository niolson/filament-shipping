     * authored configuration, and `carrier_services.carrier_id` is a
     * non-nullable FK, so an offer naming a carrier we hold no row for could
     * not be stored there at all. The production `getRates` run returned
     * exactly that case: OnTrac, eligible and cheapest, with no `Carrier` row,
     * no account and no adapter.
     *
     * Durable, unlike `shipping_offers`: an identity keeps its mapping and its
     * first-seen date for as long as the source keeps offering it. Nothing
     * purges this table.
