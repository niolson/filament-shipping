/**
 * The operations that belong to Shopify because Shopify bought the label.
 *
 * Tracking is the interesting one. USPS stopped entitling us to tracking data
 * for parcels whose barcode carries somebody else's MID (ADR-0002's entitlement
 * note), so a Shopify-bought USPS label cannot be tracked through USPS at any
 * price we would pay. It can be tracked through Shopify: Shopify holds that
 * entitlement, and reports the result on the fulfillment its purchase created
 * as `displayStatus` plus a delivery timeline.
 *
 * What comes back is coarser than a carrier feed — stage-level statuses on
 * Shopify's polling cadence, with scan detail only if `events` happens to be
 * populated — and that is accepted rather than worked around. The alternative
 * is not a better feed; it is no feed.
